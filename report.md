## 2. Modules / Functionality

The Health and Wellness Application is structured around several key modules that work together to provide a comprehensive health management solution. Each module is designed with specific functionality in mind, while maintaining seamless integration with other components of the system. This section will explore the implementation details of each major module and their interactions.

### 2.1 Authentication System

The authentication system forms the foundation of the application's security architecture. It is implemented using React's Context API, which provides a centralized way to manage user state across the application. The authentication context is created to handle user sessions, login states, and protected route access. This implementation ensures that sensitive health information and personalized features are only accessible to authenticated users.

Figure 1: Authentication Context Implementation

```jsx
// AuthContext.jsx
export const AuthProvider = ({children}) => {
    const [user, setUser] = useState(() => {
        const saved = localStorage.getItem("user");
        return saved ? JSON.parse(saved) : null;
    });

    const signup = ({age, fullName, email, password}) => {
        if (!email || !password || !age || !fullName) {
            return;
        }
        const users = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('users')) || [];
        if (users.find(u => u.email === email)) {
            throw new Error('User already exists');
        }
        const newUser = {email, password, age, fullName};
        newUser.healthRecords = [];
        newUser.medicationReminders = [];
        newUser.symptoms = [];
        newUser.mentalHealthRecords = [];
        newUser.nutritionalRecords = [];

        users.push(newUser);
        localStorage.setItem('users', JSON.stringify(users));
        setUser(newUser);
        localStorage.setItem('user', JSON.stringify(newUser));
    };
```

The authentication system implements a robust user management system that handles user registration, login, and session management. The code above shows the core authentication provider implementation, which manages user state and provides authentication methods throughout the application. The system uses localStorage for persistent session management and implements proper validation for user registration.

Figure 2: Protected Route Implementation

```jsx
// App.jsx
export const App = () => {
  const { user } = useAuth();

  return (
    <LayoutMain>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
        <Route path="/news" element={<News />} />
        <Route
          path="/symptoms-checker"
          element={user ? <Symptoms /> : <Navigate to="/signin" />}
        />
        <Route
          path="/nutritional"
          element={user ? <Nutrition /> : <Navigate to="/signin" />}
        />
        <Route
          path="/profile"
          element={user ? <Profile /> : <Navigate to="/signin" />}
        />
        <Route
          path="/mental-tools"
          element={user ? <MentalTools /> : <Navigate to="/signin" />}
        />
      </Routes>
    </LayoutMain>
  );
};
```

The routing system implements protected routes using React Router and the authentication context. As shown in Figure 2, routes that require authentication check for the presence of a user object. If no user is authenticated, the system automatically redirects to the sign-in page, ensuring that sensitive health information remains protected.

### 2.2 Core Application Features

The core features of the application are designed to provide comprehensive health management tools. The symptoms checker module implements an interactive questionnaire system that guides users through a series of health-related questions.

Figure 3: Symptoms Checker Implementation

```jsx
// symptoms/index.jsx
export const Symptoms = () => {
    const {user, updateUser} = useAuth();
    const [symptom, setSymptom] = useState("");
    const [severity, setSeverity] = useState("");
    const [notes, setNotes] = useState("");
    const [symptomsList, setSymptomsList] = useState(!user.symptoms ? [] : user.symptoms);
    const [suggestion, setSuggestion] = useState("");

    const handleAddSymptom = () => {
        if (!severity || !symptom || !notes) {
            return;
        }

        const data = {
            id: Date.now(),
            symptom,
            severity,
            notes,
            suggestion: '',
            date: new Date().toLocaleDateString(),
        }

        symptomsList.push(data)
        user.symptoms = symptomsList;
        updateUser(user);
        setSymptomsList(user.symptoms);
    };
```

The symptoms checker module, as shown in Figure 3, implements a sophisticated system for tracking and managing health symptoms. Users can input symptoms, their severity, and additional notes. The system maintains a history of symptoms and provides suggestions based on the recorded data.

Figure 4: Mental Health Tools Implementation

```jsx
// mental-tools/index.jsx
export const MentalTools = () => {
    const {user, updateUser} = useAuth();
    const [mentalHistory, setMentalHistory] = useState(user.mentalHealthRecords
        ? user.mentalHealthRecords
        : [])
    const [recommendations, setRecommendations] = useState([]);
    const [healthData, setHealthData] = useState("form");
    const [date, setDate] = useState(new Date());
    const [mood, setMood] = useState(2);
    const [energy, setEnergy] = useState(2);
    const [stress, setStress] = useState(2);

  return (
    <styles.Container>
      <styles.Header>
        <styles.Wrap>
          <styles.HeaderWrap>
            <styles.HeaderLogo src={logoIMG} />
            <styles.HeaderLinks>
              <Links orientation={"horizontal"} />
            </styles.HeaderLinks>
            <styles.HeaderBurger>
              <Burger />
            </styles.HeaderBurger>
            {user?.fullName && (
              <styles.ProfileContainer>
                <styles.ProfilePicture
                  src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/00000000000000000000000000000000?d=mp&f=y"
                  alt="Profile"
                />
                <styles.UserName>{user.fullName}</styles.UserName>
              </styles.ProfileContainer>
            )}
          </styles.HeaderWrap>
